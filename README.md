I created this little project to help my coworkers at ABATECH save some time on the usage of an excel sheet. 

The current version of the project is the skeleton on the actual working project, the main reason why I had to do this is to protect our company's information. 

Here I was practicing the implementation of anonymous functions as well as events using JavaScript.

The main purpose of the website is to avoid the usage of ctrl+c, avoid having an extra window open for excel since this website allows you to keep your work on a single window (using the web browser) finally it also helps by providing a more compact view of the information needed.
